# Testing the Webview JavaScript Fix

## Summary of Changes Made

I've fixed the webview JavaScript issues by addressing several problems:

1. **Function Declaration Order**: Moved function declarations before they are assigned to the global scope
2. **Global Scope Assignment**: Explicitly assigned functions to `window` object for VS Code webview compatibility
3. **Event Delegation**: Added comprehensive event delegation to handle clicks on buttons, lines, and comment bodies
4. **Removed Duplicate Event Listeners**: Cleaned up duplicate click event listeners that could cause conflicts
5. **Added Debugging**: Enhanced debug logging to help track event flow

## How to Test

1. **Compile the Extension**:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

2. **Launch Extension Development Host**:
   - Press F5 in VS Code with the extension project open
   - This will open a new VS Code window with the extension loaded

3. **Test the Fix**:
   - In the Extension Development Host window, look for the DiffPilot icon in the activity bar
   - Click on a changed file to open the review panel
   - Click on any line number to add a comment
   - The comment form should appear
   - Try clicking buttons (Cancel, Comment)
   - Try editing existing comments by clicking on them
   - Check the Debug Panel (top-right corner) for event logging

## What Was Fixed

### Before:
- Onclick handlers were trying to call functions that weren't accessible in the webview's execution context
- Functions were defined after being referenced in the HTML
- The globalThis assignment wasn't working properly in VS Code's sandboxed webview

### After:
- Functions are properly defined and assigned to window object
- Event delegation ensures all clicks are handled even if onclick attributes fail
- Comprehensive debugging shows exactly what's happening when you interact with the UI

## Console Debugging

When testing, open the Developer Tools in the webview:
1. Right-click in the webview panel
2. Select "Inspect" or "Open Developer Tools"
3. Check the Console tab for any errors
4. Look for [DiffPilot] prefixed messages

## Debug Panel

The webview now includes a debug panel in the top-right corner that shows:
- Real-time event logging
- Function calls and their parameters
- Error messages if any occur

## Expected Behavior

1. **Clicking on a line**: Should toggle the comment form for that line
2. **Clicking "Comment" button**: Should submit the comment and close the form
3. **Clicking "Cancel" button**: Should close the form without saving
4. **Clicking on a comment body**: Should open the edit form
5. **Escape key**: Should close any open forms
6. **Ctrl/Cmd+Enter**: Should submit the current form

If any of these behaviors don't work, check the debug panel and console for error messages.
