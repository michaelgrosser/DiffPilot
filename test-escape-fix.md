# Testing Escape Key Fix

## What was fixed:
1. Removed duplicate JavaScript code that was causing syntax errors
2. The script tag now properly closes at line 1011
3. All event handlers for Escape key and click-outside are in place

## How to test:
1. Press F5 to launch the extension
2. Open a file in the DiffPilot panel
3. Click on a line to open a comment form
4. Press Escape - the form should close
5. Click on a line again to open the form
6. Click outside the form - it should close

## What should work:
- Escape key closes new comment forms
- Clicking outside closes new comment forms
- Cancel button still works
- Edit forms continue to work with Escape and click-outside

## Code structure:
- `activeCommentForm` tracks the currently open comment form
- Escape handler splits the form ID by '-' and gets the line number
- Click outside handler checks if click was outside the form
- Both handlers call `toggleCommentForm(lineNumber)` to close the form
